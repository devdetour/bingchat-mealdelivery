# Automating Dinner with Bing Chat
This repo contains a script that can be used to create a meal delivery service with Bing Chat and Whole Foods delivery. Bing chat
will output a recipe and ingredients, and the script will take these ingredients and order them for delivery from Whole Foods.

# YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T USE THIS.
It's a fun experiment, but it's very hacky and not tested well, and I make no guarantees whatsoever for its efficacy or safety -
if you download and modify this code, and it buys a bunch of useless stuff from Amazon instead of ordering cauliflower like it should,
that's on you, I won't be liable for anything you do. I don't plan to maintain this much or at all, so if it breaks it's broken.

# But, if you still want to and you accept the risks...
## Requirements
- Acccess to Bing Chat (waiting list)
- Amazon account, with Whole Foods available for delivery nearby
- Some luck/willingness to deal with things breaking as they inevitably will, the script is not super robust

## Running
Read the instructions at the bottom of main.py.
